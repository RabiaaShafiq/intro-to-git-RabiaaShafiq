## What I've Learned

### Git and GitHub
I've gained a solid understanding of Git and GitHub during this course. I can now confidently create repositories, clone them locally, and push changes. 

### Markdown Styling
Experimenting with different Markdown styles has been a fun and creative part of this journey. I've learned how to structure headers, format text, create bullets. It's amazing how a few simple symbols can make such a difference in presentation.

## What I'm Still Confused About

### Branches and Merging
While I grasp the basic concepts of branches and merging, I'm still working on fully understanding the best practices. I want to explore strategies for managing branches in more complex projects.

### Advanced Markdown Features
I've covered the basics of Markdown, but I know there are more advanced features to discover.
